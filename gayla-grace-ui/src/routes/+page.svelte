            <p class="flex grow-0">As a young mom and stepmom thirty years ago, I longed for hope and encouragement.
                My remarriage had brought a new beginning after a messy divorce, but it also brought unique challenges and a hard-to-navigate road in our blended family.</p>
            <p class="flex grow-0">When my husband Randy and I joined our families, we didn’t know how to build loving relationships with one another.
                It was far harder than we anticipated. But in three decades of togetherness with our five kids,  I’ve learned a great deal about marriage, building strong family relationships, and pursuing a Christ-centered home.</p>
            <p class="flex grow-0">Now, I want to help others build loving relationships in marriage and family, and learn to trust God’s promises in every season.</p>
