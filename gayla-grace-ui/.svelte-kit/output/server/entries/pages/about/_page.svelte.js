I’ve been married to my best friend, Randy, for 30 years. We are a big, messy, blended family with five adult kids, two sons-in-law, two daughters-in-law, and two adorable granddaughters.</p> <p>Professionally, I’m a full-time staff member with FamilyLife®, an international organization dedicated to spreading God’s Word through the family as we seek to make every home a godly home. I regularly speak at their events, including podcasts, livestreams, and audio broadcasts.</p> <p>I’m the author of three books, including my most recent, Beautifully Blended: 101 Devotions to Encourage Couples in Blended Families.</p> <p>Most importantly, I’m a follower of Jesus Christ who turns to God’s Word and the Holy Spirit to find answers for life’s questions.</p></div></section> <section class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center m-8"><h2 class="flex flex-col text-4xl sm:text-5xl font-cursive">My Ministry Beginning</h2> <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center max-w-[768px] space-y-8 mt-8"><p>My passion for strong marriages and healthy relationships developed as a result of a messy divorce during my early adult years. I returned to school to study human behavior and earned a master’s degree in Psychology and Counseling, driven by a desire to help others build resilient families that endure over time.</p> <p>I remarried into a blended family and pursued my passion for fostering healthy relationships within my new, complex family. But, our first decade of marriage was far more challenging than we had anticipated—blending our families didn’t happen easily, and former spouses created conflict all too often.</p> <p>Over time, Randy and I learned how to parent together and work as a united team. We gained the respect of our stepchildren and began to accept each of them unconditionally. Love for one another grew, tension with our ex-spouses eased, and our marriage matured. Our family isn’t perfect, but love has won out.</p> <p>I’m passionate about helping other couples create harmony in their marriages and build strong family relationships, whether in traditional or non-traditional homes, because of the bumpy road I’ve walked. I write and speak from my own hard places with a desire to point others toward God and discover His comfort, wisdom, and peace for every season.</p></div></section> <figure class="flex justify-center m-8"><img src="/assets/family/family-pic-wedding.jpg" alt="Family at wedding" class="w-full"/></figure>`;
