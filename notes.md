- animations for wording appearing


FIGURE THIS OUT:
  - form on contact page

- speaking
  - hero optional? can use the same for now, but should consider other options - done with same as before, will revisit later
  
  - speaking TODO:
  - events (from word doc + current site)
  - women and blended family live stream (on youtube) - UPDATE: WAITING ON GRAPHIC FOR THIS
    - there's like 2 years of videos, 1 per month
    - need to describe what this is, and have a clean redirect

- books
    - 

- media
    - Podcasts
    - Video interviews


TOUCH UPS:
  testimonials:
    - consistent image sizes
    - use the same word spacing as Ron Deal's card (2/3 and 4/5 I think)



priority list:
- touch up speaking page as needed:
  - new hero graphic without B&B logo
  - consistent spacing, sizing, and flexing
- add "events" section to speaking page
- add the new endorsements to speaking page
- need to make the entire books page
- contact form
- entire media page
- decide if podcast graphic belongs on media page or speaking page
