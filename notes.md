Priority List:
Speaking Page: 
  - consistent spacing
  - Events Section 
    - the speaking events section needs to be able to fit more than 3 at a time
    - need a page or something for all the previous events she's done
About Page:
  - Contact Form
Media Page:
  - New Podcast Graphic will probably go here
Books Page:
  - I feel like this needs a header?
  - need to add "Also on my reading list" section


TOUCH UPS:
testimonials:
  - consistent image sizes
  - use the same word spacing as Ron Deal's card (2/3 and 4/5 I think)
  - add scroll-mt-xyz to all the # links that don't have it yet

FIGURE THIS OUT:
  - form on contact page
  - animations for wording appearing
  - SEO optimization

Older Speaking Notes:
  - women and blended family live stream (on youtube) - UPDATE: WAITING ON GRAPHIC FOR THIS
    - there's like 2 years of videos, 1 per month
    - need to describe what this is, and have a clean redirect
